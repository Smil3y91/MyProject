                <p>The rabbit, historically, has come to symbolize prosperity, good luck, and devotion to self-
                    improvement. Just like its namesake, Rabbit Reads wishes to facilitate the development of each
                    of these and more out of our relationship between Rabbit Reads and its authors. Our agency
                    understands that the only way we succeed is if we do everything we can to make sure that you
                    succeed
