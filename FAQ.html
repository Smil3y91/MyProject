                    <div class="faq_answer">A literary agent is an important part of the publishing process for most writers. While an agent
                        may not be needed if you want to self publish or go with a small publishing house, most
                        traditional publishing houses do not accept unsolicited work- meaning that you need an agent to
                        represent you. Getting a literary agent means you have more people in your corner to help you
                        find the best deals and publishers, meaning more marketing on your future book.</div>

                    <div class="faq_answer">Make sure you read through your manuscript to edit your work a final time and ensure it is as
                        perfect as possible. Then, your next step is to find a literary agent (like us!) so that you can start
                        reaching out to publishers. We recommend looking at resources that will help you understand
                        what goes into a good query letter so that you are successful in your endeavors to find
                        representation.</div>

                    <div class="faq_answer">Rabbit Reads does help with developmental editing of our authors’ work. Manuscripts, however,
                        should be edited to the best of the writer’s ability prior to submission to ensure that little to no
                        line or mechanical editing is necessary. Rabbit Reads is also a hands-on agent, meaning that we
                        may want to work with you on edits prior to offering you representation. Please keep in mind this
                        does not guarantee representation- but it does mean your work is well liked!</div>

                    <div class="faq_answer">With Rabbit Reads, being offered representation means that you will be offered a written
                        contract. We always recommend that you carefully read and understand the terms of your
                        contract so we can discuss any concerns you have and make sure you feel as comfortable as
                        possible. Then, your agent will start working on your behalf to find you a publisher! The most
                        important thing for you to do during this step is respond to communication with your agent in a
                        timely manner and be open to suggestions from your agent as to how to make the most of your
                        manuscript and success.</div>

                <div class="faq_answer_container">
                    <div class="faq_answer">The answer to this question depends on whether you want to get paid and have contracts in your
                        pen name. In this case, you will likely need to file a “Doing Business As” (DBA) or fictitious
                        name with your local government. If you would like to keep your information with agents and
                        publishers in your real name and just publish books in your pen name, then that can be arranged
                        with the publisher. If you have specific questions or concerns regarding your usage of a pen
                        name, we recommend that you find appropriate, reputable legal help in your area who is

                    <div class="faq_answer">If you have not signed any contracts with an agent, then there is nothing tying you to that agent.
                        If you are working with an agent and you have signed a written contract, made a verbal
                        agreement, or agreed to an agency clause, then there are some specific factors to take into
                        account:
                         Does your contract label your agent as the exclusive representation of your work? In
                        which case, you are tied into the amount of time listed in your contract and may terminate
                        the relationship upon its completion- unless of course your agent is not holding up their
                        end of the relationship, in which case you can go about terminating your relationship with
                        them as you need to for the benefit of your success. You must still make sure that you do
                        so in a way that satisfies the terms of your end of the agreement.
                         Does your contract cover one specific work does it include your future work? You may
                        find a different agent for any manuscript not covered in your current contract.
                        Keep in mind that when you decide to go about finding a new agent, it is best practice to
                        send a written notice to your current agent that you will be searching for new
                        representation. If you need help navigating legal contracts or repercussions, Rabbit Reads
                        recommends finding appropriate, reputable legal help in your area who is qualified to

                        to, if you do not hear anything back within a month, you are more than welcome to reach out a
                        second time and ensure that we did receive your manuscript.</div>
